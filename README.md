# Game of War
Using Vanilla JavaScript, I simulated the card game 'War' in the browser console. When the page loads, the deck is created and split between two players, and the game plays out. Functional logic determines who wins each round and awards the cards accordingly. If the cards are the same - war!

## Getting Started
