#Game of War
Using JavaScript, I recreated the card game 'War' in the browser console. When the page loads, the deck is created and split between two players, and the game plays out.

##Getting Started
Open the index.html file in your browser. Open the browser console to see the game play out.

##Built With
* SublimeText
